# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Missing or Corrupted 'android' folder

This repository demonstrates a common but elusive bug encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The problem stems from a missing or corrupted 'android' folder within the Expo project, often leading to vague and unhelpful error messages during the build process. This usually manifests after running `expo prebuild`. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  **Clone the repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Install dependencies:** Run `npm install` to install all required packages.
3.  **Attempt to build:** Execute `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android`. Observe the error messages.  

## Solution

The solution involves cleaning the project and forcing regeneration of the Android project files. You can find a detailed explanation and the corrected code in `expoBugSolution.js`.

## Note

This problem can stem from various factors, including incorrect configurations in `app.json` or `android/app/build.gradle`.  Thoroughly review your project files for any inconsistencies or errors.  It's also essential to have the correct Android SDK and build tools installed and configured correctly.
