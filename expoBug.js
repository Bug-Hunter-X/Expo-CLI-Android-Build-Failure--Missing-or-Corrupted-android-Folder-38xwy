This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  It happens after running `expo prebuild` and manifests as an error related to the `android` folder not being found or a problem during the Gradle build process. This is often masked by other errors, making it difficult to pinpoint. The root cause is usually related to misconfiguration or corruption within the Android project files generated by Expo.
